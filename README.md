This function, makeCacheMatrix, is designed to create a closure that stores a 
matrix and its inverse.

This function creates a closure that acts as a cache for a matrix and its inverse,
allowing users to set and retrieve the matrix, as well as set and retrieve its 
inverse. The purpose of caching the inverse is to avoid recalculating it each 
time it is needed, which can be computationally expensive for large matrices.

`makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {...}`: This line defines a function 
    named makeCacheMatrix with a default argument `x` as an empty matrix. This 
    function is meant to create a closure that will store the matrix and its 
    inverse.
`set <- function(y) {...}`: This function sets the value of the matrix x to y and 
    clears the cached inverse `p`.
`get <- function() x`: This function retrieves the current value of the matrix `x`.
`setInverse <- function(inverse) {...}`: This function sets the cached inverse of 
    the matrix to inverse.
`getInverse <- function() p`: This function retrieves the cached inverse of the matrix.
`list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)`.   
    This allows users to manipulate the matrix and its inverse using these inner
    functions.

    makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
            p <- NULL
            set <- function(y) {
                    x <<- y
                    p <<- NULL
            }
            get <- function() x
            setInverse <- function(inverse) p <<- inverse
            getInverse <- function() p
            list(set = set, get = get,
                 setInverse = setInverse,
                 getInverse = getInverse)
    }

`p <- x$getInverse()`: This line retrieves the cached inverse `p` from the closure 
    `x`.
`if(!is.null(p)) {...}`: This checks if the cached inverse `p` exists.
    If the cached inverse `p` exists, it means that the inverse has been computed 
    before and cached. In this case, a message is printed indicating that cached 
    data is being used, and the cached inverse `p` is returned immediately.
`mat <- x$get()`: If the cached inverse `p` does not exist, the function retrieves 
    the matrix mat from the closure `x`.
`p <- solve(mat, ...)`: The solve function is called to compute the inverse of 
    the matrix mat, with any additional arguments passed via .... The result is 
    stored in `p`.
`x$setInverse(p)`: The computed inverse p is cached using the setInverse function
    of the closure `x`, so that it can be reused in future calls.
The computed inverse `p` is returned.

    cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
            p <- x$getInverse()
            if(!is.null(p)) {
                    message("getting cached data")
                    return(p)
            }
            mat <- x$get()
            p <- solve(mat, ...)
            x$setInverse(p)
            p
    }
